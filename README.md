In Lab 6, I finished a program that allows for a user to set both an amount and any set of denominations they have for that amount to be found with using the least amount of that set of denominations to get that result. This can be done using a top down method where I find the least amount of denominations used to get that amount checking from largest to smallest denominations, vs. the bottom up method where it finds the least amount of denominations used to get that amount from smallest to largest denominations. Both methods enable for the minimum amount of coins to be found from the given amount and its set of denominations. In the first run, the program works to find all possibilities of results for the denominations, and tabulates them so that when a new value is entered as an amount, it can use the denominations previously stored from the numbers it has already calculated to provide the result at a significantly faster rate (vs. going through each denomination). However, if it finds that the result of minimum coins for an amount find is less than the tabulated resultâ€™s result of minimum coins, then it replaces that so that it can always work to provide the smallest amount of coins needed for a certain amount (given a certain set of denominations).
